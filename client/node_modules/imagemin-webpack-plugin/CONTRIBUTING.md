## Contributing

* The code is written in ES6 using [Javascript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard).
* Please have PRs be single-purpose and try to stick to the coding style that the plugin uses.
* Keep new features easily testable.
* Documentation PRs are more than welcome! I'm really bad at words and things, so any improvement there is always a good thing!
* I'm always looking for people to help maintain this package, if you want to get involved shoot me an email at gregbenner1@gmail.com!
